The Chicago Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians to win their first World Series in 108 years.
The Cubs won 8-7 after the deciding game needed an extra innings which was delayed for rain and ended at almost midnight on Wednesday.
The dramatic victory brought an end to the longest title drought in North American professional sports.
The triumph of Chicago's beloved Cubbies set off a wild celebration in the streets of the Windy City after more than a century of pent up frustration for fans since their last Major League Baseball championship in 1908.
MVP Zobrist, who helped the Kansas City Royals to the championship last year, said at the post-match presentation shown on BT Sport 1: "It's unbelievable. I can't even put it into words. It's an unbelievable team to be a part of.
"Every guy on this team roots for each other, takes care of each other and picks each other up and that's what we did during that rain delay."
Rizzo added: "It's the best game I've ever been a part of. What a team. We started this year as heavy favourites and we went wire to wire all year as the best team in baseball.
"The Indians did one heck of a job but this is the best feeling in the world.
"We're world champions. For the rest of our lives."

And no one was celebrating harder it seemed, than US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
The diehard Cubs fan was pictured shouting and with her fists in the air as she watched the thrilling conclusion while out on the campaign trail.
It was an unguarded moment that may cost her - Cleveland is in Ohio, likely to be one of the swing states in the upcoming election - but clearly she didn't care.
With the win, the Cubs clinched the best-of-seven series in seven games after the Indians squandered a 3-1 lead.
The Cleveland team fell one victory short of their first Major League Baseball title in 68 years.
The Cubs, who had not won baseball's biggest prize since 1908, had seen a 6-3 lead evaporate in the eighth inning but, after RBIs from Ben Zobrist and Miguel Montero, Mike Montgomery gained the final out in the 10th to secure an 8-7 victory.
It was the fourth World Series decider to go to an extra innings and the first since 1997, when the Indians were beaten by the Florida Marlins.
The Cubs, who had not even reached a World Series since 1945, are the first team to overturn a 3-1 deficit since 1985.<Node id="2736"/>
