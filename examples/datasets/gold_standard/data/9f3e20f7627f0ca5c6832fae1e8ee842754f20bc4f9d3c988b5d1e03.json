At a rally in the Detroit suburbs, Trump repeated his claims that a shadowy conspiracy is working to foil his bid to become president, telling supporters it would have been impossible for the FBI to go through as many as 650,000 emails in a short space of time. EPA 9 Trump is furious after the FBI announced his Democratic rival had no case to answer over her emails AP:Associated Press 9 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gestures as she takes the stage during a campaign rally Sunday \"Right now she's being protected by a rigged system. It's a totally rigged system. I've been saying it for a long time,\" he told supporters in Sterling Heights, Michigan. \"Hillary Clinton is guilty, she knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it and now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.\" FBI director James Comey revealed that the review did not change the agency's conclusion from July, when it said that no charges were warranted.

The Democrat's campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri welcomed the move this evening. She told reporters: \"We are glad to see that he has found - as we were confident that he would - that he's confirmed the conclusions that he reached in July. \"And we're glad that this matter is resolved.\" Related stories STERLING CHANCE Donald Trump election win could see the pound given a massive boost... but world economy could suffer about to hit the rocks?
