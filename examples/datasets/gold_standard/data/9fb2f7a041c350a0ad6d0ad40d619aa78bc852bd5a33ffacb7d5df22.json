  "text": "The Chicago Cubs shed themselves of the \"Curse of the Billy Goat\" and ended a 108-year wait for a World Series title when Ben Zobrist hit a go-ahead double in the 10th inning beating the Cleveland Indians 8-7 in 10 in a thrilling Game Seven classic in the early hours of Thursday. The triumph of Chicago's beloved Cubbies set off a wild celebration in the streets of the Windy City after more than a century of pent up frustration for fans since their last Major League Baseball championship in 1908.",
