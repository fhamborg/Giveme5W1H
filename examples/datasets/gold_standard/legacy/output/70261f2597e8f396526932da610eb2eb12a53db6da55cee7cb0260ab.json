  "text": "Fans of the iconic Toblerone bar have hit out at the chocolate company's decision to change the shape and size of the bars. Mondelez International, which makes the bars, said it had been forced to make the distinctive triangular bars smaller because of rising costs. Their UK bars will now be made with a wider gap in between each peak - reducing the 400g bar to 360g and the 170g to 150g. But the news has left many fans of the Swiss chocolate bar angry and \"disappointed\" - with the new look of the bars called \"stupid\" for straying from the original design. Philip Joseph said on the company's Facebook page: \"It was the wrong decision. It looks like a really underhanded thing to do. You buy a bar expecting a normal bar and it looks like you are getting half the chocolate.\" Others called on the company to show the price increases which they have been hit by and asked why customers were not consulted. Richard Cristiano Tamerighi said it was \"just plain dumb changing the trademark shape of your flagship product\". Some people posted photos of the new shape online and offered their opinions. New review: Toblerone Milk Chocolate - weird block change! https://t.co/HDwtHAKPz0 #Toblerone #mondelez pic.twitter.com/0ppfOTRVJe -- Kevs Snack Reviews (@kevvieguy) November 7, 2016 Toblerone is ruined with that massive gap.    -- Syeda [?][?] (@LaLaSyeda) November 8, 2016  Toblerone off the Xmas list now. Knock a triangle off - not increase the gap! #toblerone @Toblerone -- Neil R (@Neilndown) November 8, 2016 Lee Yarker, who bought one of the new bars, said: \"Fair enough reducing the weight of the bar, but why the big gap in between segments? Looks stupid imo, could have just made the bar shorter and kept the original design\". Toblerone said it was faced with a choice to change either the shape of the bar or raising the price - but said it decided to change the shape to \"keep the product affordable\". It said in a statement: \"Like many other companies, we are experiencing higher costs for numerous ingredients. \"We carry these costs for as long as possible, but to ensure Toblerone remains on-shelf, is affordable and retains the triangular shape, we have had to reduce the weight of just two of our bars in the UK, from the wider range of available Toblerone products.\"",
