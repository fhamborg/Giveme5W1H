Some 80 diggers have been dispatched to the village in central China to save the five-year-old after his family claimed he had plummeted into a 130-foot-deep chute last week. The team of rescuers have been searching for the child for more than 85 hours as of writing. Where is the boy? Rescuers have worked around the clock for more than three days Five-year-old Zhao Sicong, from China, fell into a deserted well on Sunday, his family claimed After the family alerted the authority, a large team of rescuers have been sent to save the child Rescue operation has been going on for more than 85 hours around the clock as of writing However, the child's uncle told a reporter that he found the well to be empty this morning The boy's uncle, Song Jiandang, told a reporter from The Paper that he only saw a pile of dry mud at the bottom of the well as he carried out excavations this morning in the village of Zhongmengchang in Lixian County, Hebei's Baoding city. Mr Song said he was digging the earth with another family member and one volunteer from the same village. The uncle said they dug from 5am for about two hours. The boy's uncle said he only saw a pile of dry mud at the bottom of the well when he peeked The man said he was about 13 feet from the bottom of the well and he looked down the well The man was puzzled when he saw nobody in the well and he had no idea where the boy was As they were about four metres (13 feet) from the bottom of the well, the boy's uncle turned on a torch and looked down the well. Surprisingly, he found nobody there. A puzzled Mr Song also claimed that the rescuers had used life detectors for four or five times during the operation, and they couldn't find any signs of life either. The excavation is still ongoing as of writing.
