Massa's Williams car crashed in lap 48 as the Brazilian struggled to cope with the endless downpour on his home track of Interlagos. AP:Associated Press 5 Felipe Massa waves to the crowd of adoring fans after the race Getty Images 5 The Brazilian is retiring from F1 at the end of the season and raced for the last time at Interlagos Getty Images 5 Massa sits down whilst the race was suspended due to heavy rain Massa escaped the circuit and the weather to huge cheers from the crowd as it finally hit home that one of greats of F1 is about to retire. The Brazilian fought back tears as he was overwhelmed by the emotion coming from his home crowd. Massa said: \"It's difficult to explain the feeling. To not manage to finish the race, for my fans, for Brazil. \"This place is so special for me but God knows what to do. \"It's so special from the people in Brazil, in the paddock, everyone that I work for. \"I just say thank you very much. It's a real honour, a real pleasure. \"It's difficult to explain. related articles Gunning for glory How can Nico Rosberg can be crowned as Formula One world champion this weekend?

Massa was given a guard of honour as he walked to meet his wife Anna Raffaella and son Felipinho whom he hugged, kissed and sobbed. Lewis Hamilton eventually won a very dangerous Grand Prix that saw a number of cars aquaplaning across the track with the worry that life threatening accidents could be on the verge of unfolding if the weather was to continue to get worse. Fortunately there were no serious injuries amongst the crashes and the debris as the championship is still left hanging in the balance.
