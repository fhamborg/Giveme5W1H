  "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Japan would shoot North Korean missiles \u201cout of the sky\u201d if it bought the U.S. weaponry needed for doing so, suggesting Tokyo take a stance it has avoided until now.\nNorth Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan.\nTrump, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, repeated his mantra the \u201cera of strategic patience\u201d with North Korea was over, and said the two countries were working to counter the \u201cdangerous aggressions\u201d.\nTrump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.\n\u201cHe (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,\u201c Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles. \u201dThe prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment by far.\u201d\nAbe, for his part, said Tokyo would shoot down missiles \u201cif necessary\u201d.\nTrump was replying to a question that was posed to Abe - namely how he would respond to a quote from Trump from a recent interview in which he said Japan was a \u201csamurai\u201d nation and should have shot down the North Korean missiles.\nJapan\u2019s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on Japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Japan because it was aimed at a U.S. target.\nThe U.S. president is on the second day of a 12-day Asian trip that is focusing on North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile programs and trade.\n\u201cMost importantly, we\u2019re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea,\u201d Trump said, calling Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over Japan \u201ca threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability\u201d.\n\u201cSome people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what\u2019s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now,\u201d he added.\nNorth Korea\u2019s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump\u2019s presidency.\nThe U.S. leader, who will visit South Korea on the trip, has rattled some allies with his vow to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a \u201crocket man\u201d on a suicide mission.\nAbe, with whom Trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls, repeated at the same news conference that Japan backed Trump\u2019s stance that \u201call options\u201d are on the table, saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the two countries were \u201c100 percent\u201d together on the issue.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe\u2019s comments, said that the North Korean \u201csituation\u201d was \u201calready extremely complex, sensitive and weak\u201d.\n\u201cWe hope that under the present circumstances, all sides\u2019 words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the North Korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations,\u201d she said.\nTRADE DEFICITS\nWaiters hold U.S. President Donald Trump's Diet Coke as he delivers remarks before his toast to Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during an official dinner in Trump's honor at Akasaka Palace in Tokyo, Japan November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\nTrump said he was committed to achieving \u201cfree, fair, and reciprocal\u201d trade and wants to work with Japan on this issue.\n\u201cAmerica is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs president, I\u2018m committed to achieving fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan\u2019s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan.\u201d\nEarlier, speaking to Japanese and U.S. business executives, Trump praised Japan for buying U.S. military hardware.\nBut he added that \u201cmany millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan\u201d.\nJapan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The United States was Japan\u2019s second biggest trade partner after China, while Japan was the United States\u2019 fourth largest goods export market in 2016.\nEMPEROR, ABDUCTEES\nSlideshow (25 Images)\nJapanese officials have countered U.S. trade complaints by noting Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China\u2019s imbalance is bigger.\nIn a second round of economic talks in Washington last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, failed to bridge differences on trade issues.\nThe two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement.\nTrump also said earlier that an Indo-Pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced Washington would abandon soon after he took office.\nThe 11 remaining nations in the TPP, to which Japan\u2019s Abe is firmly committed, are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the United States.\nTrump met Emperor Akihito, exchanging a handshake and nodding, before his lunch and talks with Abe.\nHe also met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago to help train spies, calling the kidnappings a \u201ctremendous disgrace\u201d and pledging to work with Abe to bring the victims \u201cback to Japan where they want to be\u201d.\n\u201cI think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf he would send them back, that would be the start of something, something very special.\u201d\nAbe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career. The families hope their talks with Trump - the third U.S. president they have met - will somehow contribute to a breakthrough, although experts say progress is unlikely.\nAbe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least 26 worshippers at a church in Texas.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump had no plans to change the schedule for his 12-day Asian trip, which will also take him to Seoul, Beijing and Danang, Vietnam.\nTrump's visit to Asia: tmsnrt.rs/2znSb0v",
