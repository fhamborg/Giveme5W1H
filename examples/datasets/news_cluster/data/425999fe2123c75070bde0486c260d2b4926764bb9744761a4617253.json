  "text": "Photo\nMillions more people were affected by Equifax\u2019s data breach than the credit bureau initially estimated, Equifax said on Monday.\nThe company increased its estimate on the number of Americans whose personal information was potentially exposed to 145.5 million, some 2.5 million more than it had previously disclosed.\nThe additional accounts were found during a forensic review by Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm hired by Equifax to investigate the attack, according to a company statement.\nEquifax has been reeling since its announcement last month that hackers exploited a vulnerability in its website software to access its systems and extract sensitive personal information of millions of consumers. The material that was stolen included names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver\u2019s license numbers.\nRichard F. Smith, who stepped down last week as Equifax\u2019s chief executive, is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before a congressional subcommittee that is investigating the theft and Equifax\u2019s response to it. It is the first of four congressional hearings he is scheduled to speak at this week.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\u201cI am deeply sorry that this occurred,\u201d Mr. Smith said in prepared remarks released on Monday. \u201cEquifax was entrusted with Americans\u2019 private data and we let them down.\u201d",
