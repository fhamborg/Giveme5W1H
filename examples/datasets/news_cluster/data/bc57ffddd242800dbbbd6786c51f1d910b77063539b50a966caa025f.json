Sunday night\u2019s performance was the festival\u2019s last scheduled show.\nTwitter/EirikurH via Storyful\nBloodied victims were seen lying on the ground at the festival.\nDavid Becker/Getty Images\nConcertgoers described hearing round after round of gunfire. \u201cThis shooting was going on for at least 10 minutes,\u201d said Jake Owen, a country singer who was on stage with Mr. Aldean when the shooting began.\nA Frantic Search for the Gunman\n[The account below is based primarily on recordings of police communications, captured by Broadcastify.com and some individuals.]\nAt 10:08 p.m., an officer on the scene sounds the alarm. \u201cWe got shots fired,\u201d he says. \u201cSounds like an automatic firearm.\u201d\nThere is confusion over the next few minutes as officers arrive to scenes of death and mayhem.\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming from upstairs in the Mandalay Bay. Upstairs in the Mandalay Bay, halfway up I see the shots coming from Mandalay Bay, halfway up.\u201d\n\u201cWe have an active shooter \u2014 we have an active shooter inside the fairgrounds!\u201d\nAt 10:12 p.m., the scale of the attack becomes more clear as an officer, using law-enforcement shorthand for gunshot wounds, reports in an agitated voice: \u201cWe have multiple casualties. G.S.W.\u2019s in the medical tent. Multiple casualties!\u201d\nBut the confusion over the source of the gunshots continues:\n\u201cShots are coming from Gate 7.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re in front of Mandalay Bay. We\u2019re trying to see where the shots are coming from. If anyone can advise if they\u2019re coming from Mandalay.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s either Mandalay or Luxor, we cannot tell.\u201d\nAt 10:13 p.m., the manhunt begins to focus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming from like the 50th or 60th floor, north of the Mandalay Bay! It\u2019s coming out a window.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing local flashes in the middle of Mandalay Bay on the north side, kind of on the west tower but towards the center of the casino, like one of the middle floors.\u201d\nThe gunman had smashed two windows that have a broad view of the festival ground, the sheriff said later at a news conference.\nJohn Locher/Associated Press\nEven with pandemonium on the streets, one officer has clearly identified where the shooting is coming from:\n\u201cI\u2019m inside the Mandalay Bay on the 31st floor, I can hear the automatic fire coming from one floor ahead, one floor above us.\u201d\n\u201cRepeating, just be advised it is automatic fire. Fully automatic fire from an elevated position. Take cover.\u201d\n\u201cThat is correct, it\u2019s fully automatic fire. I\u2019m right below it.\u201d\nOutside, frustration grows.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking gunfire. It\u2019s going right over our heads. There\u2019s debris coming over our heads. We\u2019re pinned down here with a bunch of civilians.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t worry about victims, we need to snuff the shooter before we have more victims! Anybody have eyes on him, on this shooter?\u201d\n\u201cHey officers, please stay calm, just relax, we\u2019re trying to get this set up.\u201d\nBy 10:20 p.m., there are some indications the shooting has stopped, although it is not clear.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since we\u2019ve heard any shots. Does anybody have eyes on the shooter?\u201d\nA later transmission indicates that the shooting may have ended about 10:25.\nAt 10:24 p.m., officers report from the stairwell just outside the gunman\u2019s door.\n\u201cI\u2019m on the 32nd floor. The room is going to be 135.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s room 135 on the 32nd floor. I need the SWAT.\u201d\nAt 10:28 p.m., as SWAT teams gather on the 32nd floor and the 29th floor, where there have been erroneous reports of another gunman, an officer says that a hotel security officer has been shot.\nThe gunman was at one point in a large suite on the 32nd floor, with windows facing the concert grounds.

By The New York Times\nOver the next 50 minutes, officers secure the floor and ready several SWAT teams.\nAt about 11:20 p.m., they explode a door-breaching device, and enter to find the suspect dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The man, who was later identified as Stephen Paddock, 64, had an arsenal of firearms in the room, officials said.\nAbout the Hotel\nThe Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino anchors the southern tip of a row of luxury hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard known as the Strip. It is the first major casino north of the famous \u201cWelcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\u201d sign.",
