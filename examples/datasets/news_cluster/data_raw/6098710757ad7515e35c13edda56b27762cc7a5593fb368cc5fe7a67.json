  "text": "The settlements have long been a source of friction between Israel and the United States, along with much of the rest of the world. Most countries view settlement construction as a violation of international law and an impediment to a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; the Obama administration has described the settlements as \u201cillegitimate.\u201d\nIsrael considers the West Bank territory that it conquered from Jordan in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 to be disputed, not occupied, and says the fate of the settlements should be determined in negotiations.\nUnder growing international pressure, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Lieberman recently affirmed their commitment to the principle of \u201ctwo states for two peoples,\u201d meaning the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, but the Palestinians and others are skeptical about the Israelis\u2019 motives.\nPhoto\n\u201cIsrael is doing everything possible to sabotage every effort to achieve a just and lasting peace,\u201d Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement after the Israeli government approved the settlement financing. \u201cIt is time for the international community to assume its responsibilities towards this extremist government that openly supports apartheid and stands against the two-state solution.\u201d\nWhile strengthening the settlements, Israel has continued to demolish unlicensed Palestinian homes and livestock pens in the part of the West Bank known as Area C, the more than 60 percent of the territory where Israel exercises full security and civil control.\nThe financing measure was approved after months of deadly Palestinian attacks in and around the settlements, as well as in Jerusalem and in cities around Israel.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Citing the nuclear agreement with Iran, which Mr. Netanyahu strenuously opposed, and the capabilities of the military, he said, \u201cI can say that today and in the foreseeable future, there is no existential threat on the State of Israel.\u201d\nEhud Barak, another former military chief and defense minister, who, as the leader of the center-left Labor Party, served a short and largely unsuccessful term as prime minister, said at the conference that \u201ca fanatic seed of extreme ideology has taken over the Likud.\u201d\nHe added that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s priority was not security but \u201ca slow and cunning advancement of the one-state solution agenda.\u201d Mr. Barak said that would lead to either an apartheid state or a binational state \u201cin which the Jews will become a minority within a couple of generations.\u201d\nLikud dismissed Mr. Barak, who also gave a lengthy television interview on Friday night, as a failed politician who was seeking attention. Mr. Netanyahu rejected Mr. Yaalon\u2019s criticism as politically motivated, saying in a statement, \u201cYou cannot express full confidence in the leadership when you are on the inside and say the absolute opposite when you are on the outside.\u201d",
