A male gorilla is standing over him.\"\nThere are then repeated shouts of \"be calm, be calm\" as she struggles to contain her panic.\nThe distressed mother can then be heard saying: \"He's dragging my son, I can't watch this.\"\nIsiah's family released a statement today thanking their supporters - despite a worldwide public backlash against them.\nThey urged people to donate money in Harambe's name.\nRelated stories It happened to me \u2018My husband died while I was pregnant\u2019: One mum's account of love and loss PIVOTAL MOMENT Tomorrow's clash with Portugal will be England's 50th game at the new Wembley Stadium Trouble in store Fears grow that customers have being paying out BILLIONS in store card claims for last 40 years Break It Off Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris split after 15 month romance\nThe statement said: \"Our child has had a checkup by his doctor and is still doing well.\n\"We continue to praise God for His grace and mercy, and to be thankful to the Cincinnati Zoo for their actions taken to protect our child.\n\"We are also very appreciative for the expressions of concern and support that have been sent to us.\n\"Some have offered money to the family, which we do not want and will not accept.
