  "text": "A photo issued by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch of the tram which derailed near the Sandilands stop in Croydon, London, Nov. 9, 2016. (Photo: AP)\nA least seven people were killed Wednesday when a two-car tram jumped the rails on a sharp curve in south London and flipped on its side, according to British rail investigators and media reports.\nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch said the tram was negotiating a \"sharp, left-hand curve with a speed limit of 12 mph\" when it tipped over.\n\"The derailment occurred on the curve and initial indications suggest that the tram was traveling at a significantly higher speed than is permitted,\" the RAIB said in a statement.\nPolice said more than 50 people were injured in the accident that occurred next to an underpass in the Croydon area. Emergency workers labored for hours to free five people trapped in the wreckage.\nAuthorities arrested the 42-year-old driver of the London Tramlink two-car vehicle, according to Sky News.\nMartin Bamford, 30, a passenger, said the train sped up and \u201ceveryone just literally went flying,\u201d the Associated Press reports.\n\u201cThere was a woman that was on top of me \u2026 I don\u2019t think she made it at all,\u201d Bamford said outside Croydon University Hospital, where he was treated for rib injuries. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t responsive. There was blood everywhere.\u201d Bamford said the driver told him that \u201che thinks he blacked out.\u201d\nThe British capital\u2019s only tram network operates in the southern end of the city, serving 27 million passengers in the past year.\nWednesday\u2019s derailment is the first tram accident with onboard fatalities since the 1950s, but official figures show 20 people were injured in 112 tram-related accidents between March 2015 and March 2016, including one derailment and two collisions with other trams.\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fD4PNp",
