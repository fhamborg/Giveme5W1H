  "text": "SEOUL/UNITED NATIONS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The United Nations condemned North Korea\u2019s \u201coutrageous\u201d firing of a ballistic missile over Japan, demanding that the isolated country halts its weapons program but holding back on any threat of new sanctions.\nNorth Korea said the launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) was to counter U.S. and South Korean military drills and was a first step in military action in the Pacific to \u201ccontain\u201d the U.S. territory of Guam.\nThe North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un, ordered the launch to be conducted for the first time from its capital, Pyongyang, and said more exercises with the Pacific as the target were needed, the North\u2019s KCNA news agency said on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe current ballistic rocket launching drill like a real war is the first step of the military operation of the KPA in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam,\u201d KCNA quoted Kim as saying. KPA stands for the Korean People\u2019s Army.\nAndrew Kelly / Reuters The United Nations Security Council said it was of \u201cvital importance\u201d that North Korea take immediate, concrete actions to reduce tensions, however, a U.S.-drafted statement did not threaten new sanctions.\nNorth Korea this month threatened to fire four missiles into the sea near Guam, home to a major U.S. military presence, after President Donald Trump said the North would face \u201cfire and fury\u201d if it threatened the United States.\nIn a statement, the 15-member Security Council said it was of \u201cvital importance\u201d that North Korea take immediate, concrete actions to reduce tensions and called on all states to implement U.N. sanctions.\nHowever, the U.S.-drafted statement, which was agreed by consensus, does not threaten new sanctions on North Korea.\nDiplomats say veto-wielding council members China and Russia typically only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible sanctions.\nChina\u2019s and Russia\u2019s ambassadors to the United Nations said they opposed any unilateral sanctions on North Korea and reiterated calls to halt deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea.\n\u201cI certainly hope that we\u2019ll be able to have a strong resolution following up this ... statement,\u201d Japan\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations, Koro Bessho, told reporters after the meeting.\nSpeaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China was discussing the situation with other Security Council members and would make a \u201cnecessary response\u201d based on the consensus reached. China is the North\u2019s lone major ally.\n\u201cAny measures against North Korea should be under the U.N. Security Council framework, and should be carried out according to Security Council resolutions,\u201d he told a news briefing.\nUnilateral sanctions did not accord with international law, Wang added, a reference to sanctions imposed on Chinese firms and citizens by the United States and Japan.\nSpeaking during a visit to the Japanese city of Osaka, British Prime Minister Theresa May called on China to put more pressure on North Korea, saying Beijing had a key role to play.\nAsked about her comments, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said some \u201crelevant sides\u201d were only selectively carrying out the U.N. resolutions by pushing hard on sanctions yet neglecting to push for a return to talks.\nShe said this was not the attitude \u201cresponsible countries\u201d should have when the \u201csmell of gunpowder\u201d remained strong over the Korean peninsula.\n\u201cWhen it comes to sanctions, they storm to the front but when it comes to pushing for peace they hide at the very back,\u201d Hua told a daily news briefing.\nALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE\nTuesday\u2019s test was of the same Hwasong-12 missile Kim had threatened to use on Guam, but the test flight took it in another direction, over northern Japan\u2019s Hokkaido and into the sea.\nTrump, who has vowed not to let North Korea develop nuclear missiles that can hit the mainland United States, said the world had received North Korea\u2019s latest message \u201cloud and clear.\u201d\n\u201cThreatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime\u2019s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe Trump administration plans to name a former White House official, Victor Cha, as the next U.S. ambassador to South Korea, according to an administration official.\nCha served as deputy head of the U.S. delegation in multilateral talks with North Korea over its nuclear program during the administration of President George W. Bush.\nThe North\u2019s latest test launch came as U.S. and South Korean forces conducted annual military exercises on the Korean peninsula, angering Pyongyang which sees the war games as a preparation for invasion.\nNorth Korea has conducted dozens of ballistic missile tests under Kim in defiance of U.N. sanctions, but firing a projectile over mainland Japan was a rare and provocative move.\nLACKING DETAIL\nReports of the launch by North Korean media were lacking the usual boasts of technical advances.\nThe 2,700 km (1,680 miles) the missile flew before splashing down was much shorter and at a lower trajectory than that of an earlier launch of the same missile type.\n\u201cIt is not clear what new North Korea would have learned from this launch that is relevant to a long-range missile,\u201d missile expert David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists said.\nThe shorter range points to an intended early cutting of the engine thrust or a possible mechanical problem, as the trajectory taken would not have been useful in simulating re-entry or heating of the missile, Wright wrote in a blog post.\nKim Dong-yup, professor at the Institute for Far East Studies of Kyungnam University in Seoul, said firing the missile from a densely populated area near Pyongyang and over Japan suggested North Korea was confident in the missile\u2019s stability.\n\u201cI do not think North Korea factored in much military meaning behind yesterday\u2019s missile launch, rather yesterday\u2019s launch was all about North Korea being stubborn,\u201d he said.",
