But it has told the public that it knows exactly what is going on with it.\nTiangong-1, which translates as \u201cheavenly palace\u201d, was launched into orbit in 2011. Since then it has been undertaking experiments, in large part as a test to have a permanent station in space by 2023.\nNasa's most stunning pictures of space\n+ show all Nasa's most stunning pictures of space\n1/30 Earth from the ISS From the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W. Virts took this photograph of the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. Gulf Coast at sunset Nasa\n2/30 Frosty slopes of Mars This image of an area on the surface of Mars, approximately 1.5 by 3 kilometers in size, shows frosted gullies on a south-facing slope within a crater.

On this mission, Kathryn Sullivan became the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk and Marc Garneau became the first Canadian in space. The crew of seven was the largest to fly on a spacecraft at that time, and STS-41G was the first flight to include two female astronauts\n17/30 A Fresh Perspective on an Extraordinary Cluster of Galaxies Galaxy clusters are often described by superlatives. After all, they are huge conglomerations of galaxies, hot gas, and dark matter and represent the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravity\n18/30 Veil Nebula Supernova Remnant Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope has unveiled in stunning detail a small section of the Veil Nebula - expanding remains of a massive star that exploded about 8,000 years ago\n19/30 Hubble Sees a Galactic Sunflower The arrangement of the spiral arms in the galaxy Messier 63, seen here in an image from the Nasa Hubble Space Telescope, recall the pattern at the center of a sunflower\n20/30 A Hubble Cosmic Couple The spectacular cosmic pairing of the star Hen 2-427 \u2014 more commonly known as WR 124 \u2014 and the nebula M1-67 which surrounds it\n21/30 Pluto image Four images from New Horizons\u2019 Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with colour data from the Ralph instrument to create this enhanced colour global view of Pluto\n22/30 Fresh Crater Near Sirenum Fossae Region of Mars The HiRISE camera aboard Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter acquired this closeup image of a \"fresh\" (on a geological scale, though quite old on a human scale) impact crater in the Sirenum Fossae region of Mars. This impact crater appears relatively recent as it has a sharp rim and well-preserved ejecta\n23/30 Earth Observations From Gemini IV in 1965 This photograph of the Florida Straits and Grand Bahama Bank was taken during the Gemini IV mission during orbit no. 19 in 1965.

Vibrant bands of clouds carried by winds that can exceed 400 mph continuously circle the planet's atmosphere\n30/30 Chandra Observatory Sees a Heart in the Darkness This Chandra X-Ray Observatory image of the young star cluster NGC 346 highlights a heart-shaped cloud of 8 million-degree Celsius gas in the central region\nIt was supposed to be decommissioned in 2013, with a controlled destruction. That has been repeatedly delayed, however, leading to fears that it could be out of control and the Chinese space agency is simply waiting for it to fall back to Earth.\nIf it did so and managed to land over a populated area, the remains of the space station that don\u2019t burn up on re-entry could cause serious damage.\nZhu Congpeng, a top engineer at the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, told the state-backed Science and Technology Daily newspaper that the space station was not crashing and did not pose a safety or environmental threat.\n\u201cWe have been continuously monitoring Tiangong-1 and expect to allow it to fall within the first half of this year,\u201d Mr Zhu told the newspaper.\n\u201cIt will burn up on entering the atmosphere and the remaining wreckage will fall into a designated area of the sea, without endangering the surface,\u201d he said.\nRe-entry was delayed in September 2017 in order to ensure that the wreckage would fall into an area of the south Pacific Ocean where debris from Russian and US space stations had previously landed, the paper said.\nThe California-based Aerospace Corporation, a non-profit group that conducts federal research, said the Tiangong-1\u2019s re-entry was unlikely to be controlled but was highly unlikely to hit people or damage property, according to a post on its website last updated 3 January.\n\u201cAlthough not declared officially, it is suspected that control of Tiangong-1 was lost and will not be regained before re-entry,\u201d it said. There may be hazardous material on board that could survive re-entry, it said.\nAdvancing China\u2019s space programme is a priority for President Xi Jinping, who has called for China to become a global space power with both advanced civilian space flight and capabilities that strengthen national security.\nBeijing insists that its space programme is for peaceful purposes, but the US Defence Department has said China\u2019s programme could be aimed at blocking adversaries from using space-based assets during a crisis.\nReuters",
